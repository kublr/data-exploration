# data-exploration

There are two dockers. 
1. WORKER DOCKER - creates a worker which accepts parameters and runs a random forest with those parameters. The worker then sends the accuracy result to a handler worker.
Random forest will train using the dataset which is located in the mounted folder and is called:
```
ToTrainDataset.csv
```
The dataset that was used is located in this repo.


Building worker:
```
docker build -t kublr/data-exploration:latest
```
Here kublr/data-exploration:latest is a tag that is used to run the worker and commit to docker hub


Running worker:
The worker needs the following args to be set:
```
RABBIT_USERNAME_SET= "admin user name of rabbitmq"
RABBIT_USERPASS_SET= "Password to the user name"
RABBIT_IP_SET= "IP or link on which rabbit server is running"
```
You can set them either in the docker file or pass them as parameters.

If you set them in docker file use this command to run: 
```
docker run -i -v mountFolderFromLocal:/opt/volume data-exploration:latest
```
If you wish to pass them use this command:
```
sudo docker run -i -v mountFolderFromLoca:/opt/volume -e RABBIT_IP_SET=LINK -e RABBIT_USERPASS_SET=USER -e RABBIT_USERNAME_SET=PASS data-exploration:latest 
```
Replace: LINK, USER, PASS
Make sure that mount folder starts from root of the computer. Ex: /home/user/Desktop/MountFolder


2. HANDLER WORKER - receives the results from workers and puts them in a list in the mounted folder. There should only be one handler worker per one queue since the handler worker launches the scheduler as well and the scheduler creates an execution queue.


Building worker:
```
docker build -t kublr/data-exploration-handler:latest
```
Here kublr/data-exploration:latest is a tag that is used to run the worker and commit to docker hub

Running worker:
The worker needs the following args to be set:
```
RABBIT_USERNAME_SET= "admin user name of rabbitmq"
RABBIT_USERPASS_SET= "Password to the user name"
RABBIT_IP_SET= "IP or link on which rabbit server is running"
```
You can set them either in the docker file or pass them as parameters.

If you set them in docker file use this command to run: 
```
docker run -i -v mountFolderFromLocal:/opt/volume data-exploration-handler:latest
```
If you wish to pass them use this command:
```
sudo docker run -i -v mountFolderFromLoca:/opt/volume -e RABBIT_IP_SET=LINK -e RABBIT_USERPASS_SET=USER -e RABBIT_USERNAME_SET=PASS data-exploration-handler:latest 
```
Replace: LINK, USER, PASS
Make sure that mount folder starts from root of the computer. Ex: /home/user/Desktop/MountFolder

Handler worker will create a Results.csv in the mounted folder. This file will show which variables were used to run the random forest and it will show the accuracy of the random forest run.
